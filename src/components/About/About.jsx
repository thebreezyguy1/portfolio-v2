      <p>
        I'm a curious and driven Computer Science student, graduating in May
        2025, with a strong foundation in software engineering, distributed
        systems, and AI-powered solutions. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to intern at
        Afriland First Bank and MK World Business, where I built robust backend
        services and cross-platform mobile apps that improved system efficiency
        and user engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the code, I'm an active member of the National Society of Black
        Engineers and ColorStack, and Iâ€™ve earned multiple honors including
        back-to-back Presidentâ€™s List recognition.
